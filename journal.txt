Week 1:
This week, I used some AI while working on the exercises. I asked ChatGPT to explain basic Python concepts such as f-strings, boolean expressions, string methods like .strip() and .find(), and how to print formatted results. I also used AI to help me understand how to run my Jupyter notebook in VS Code.

Week 2:
This week, I used AI while working on the exercises. I asked ChatGPT to teach me about conditionals (if/elif/else), loops, list operations such as append, remove, and insert, and how to fix common runtime errors like NameError and indentation errors. ChatGPT walked me through debugging when authors and loan_counts were not defined and helped me understand how notebook kernels reset memory.

Week 3: 
This week, I used AI to help me understand how to write and test Python functions. I asked ChatGPT to explain how return works, how to pass arguments, how to update lists inside functions, and why you use helper functions like normalize_title to avoid repeating code. This was very useful for completing the function-based library management exercises.

Week 4:
This week, AI played a bigger role in helping me complete the assignment on classes and objects. I asked ChatGPT to explain how __init__ works, how to store attributes on self, and how to design simple instance methods that update those attributes (for example, the Shelf, BookCopy, and CopyTracker classes). I also used it to understand why some of my methods were failing the assert tests and how to fix my logic without changing the tests.

Week 5:
This week, I used AI to help me understand encapsulation and data hiding in Python. I asked ChatGPT to explain how private attributes (__x) and protected ones (_x) work, and how to use @property and setter methods to validate data for classes like Book, Member, Account, and Settings.

Week 6:
This week I used AI to help me understand class methods and static methods in Python. I asked ChatGPT to explain when to use instance methods vs class methods, and how to let a class generate things like IDs or preset policies. I also used it to check my logic for date calculations and renewals in the Loan exercises.

Week 7:
This week I used AI to help me understand exception handling in Python and basic unit testing. I asked ChatGPT to walk me through raising custom errors, catching different exception types, and when to use try/except/else/finally. I also used it to build simple unittest cases and understand how to assert that errors should be raised.

Week 8:
This week I used AI to help me understand inheritance and polymorphism in Python. I asked ChatGPT to show me how to create subclasses like PrintedBook, EBook, and AudioBook that override methods from Book, and how to use super() correctly inside describe() methods. I also used it to see how polymorphic methods like late_fee() and checkout_message() can replace big if/elif chains and still handle different behaviors for each subclass.
