Week 1:
This week, I used some AI while working on the exercises. I asked ChatGPT to explain basic Python concepts such as f-strings, boolean expressions, string methods like .strip() and .find(), and how to print formatted results. I also used AI to help me understand how to run my Jupyter notebook in VS Code.

Week 2:
This week, I used AI while working on the exercises. I asked ChatGPT to teach me about conditionals (if/elif/else), loops, list operations such as append, remove, and insert, and how to fix common runtime errors like NameError and indentation errors. ChatGPT walked me through debugging when authors and loan_counts were not defined and helped me understand how notebook kernels reset memory.

Week 3: 
This week, I used AI to help me understand how to write and test Python functions. I asked ChatGPT to explain how return works, how to pass arguments, how to update lists inside functions, and why you use helper functions like normalize_title to avoid repeating code. This was very useful for completing the function-based library management exercises.

Week 4:
This week, AI played a bigger role in helping me complete the assignment on classes and objects. I asked ChatGPT to explain how __init__ works, how to store attributes on self, and how to design simple instance methods that update those attributes (for example, the Shelf, BookCopy, and CopyTracker classes). I also used it to understand why some of my methods were failing the assert tests and how to fix my logic without changing the tests.

Week 5:
This week, I used AI to help me understand encapsulation and data hiding in Python. I asked ChatGPT to explain how private attributes (__x) and protected ones (_x) work, and how to use @property and setter methods to validate data for classes like Book, Member, Account, and Settings.

Week 6:
This week I used AI to help me understand class methods and static methods in Python. I asked ChatGPT to explain when to use instance methods vs class methods, and how to let a class generate things like IDs or preset policies. I also used it to check my logic for date calculations and renewals in the Loan exercises.

Week 7:
This week I used AI to help me understand exception handling in Python and basic unit testing. I asked ChatGPT to walk me through raising custom errors, catching different exception types, and when to use try/except/else/finally. I also used it to build simple unittest cases and understand how to assert that errors should be raised.

Week 8:
This week I used AI to help me understand inheritance and polymorphism in Python. I asked ChatGPT to show me how to create subclasses like PrintedBook, EBook, and AudioBook that override methods from Book, and how to use super() correctly inside describe() methods. I also used it to see how polymorphic methods like late_fee() and checkout_message() can replace big if/elif chains and still handle different behaviors for each subclass.

Week 9:
This week I used AI to help me understand abstract base classes and interfaces in Python. I asked ChatGPT to explain how LibraryItem works as an abstract base class with @abstractmethod, abstract properties like is_digital and media_type, and class methods like kind(). I also used it to understand how concrete subclasses like PrintedBook, EBook, and AudioBook implement these methods, how late_fee() can be defined once in the ABC and customized via daily_late_fee() in each subclass, and how virtual subclasses and Protocols (like Downloadable) let different objects follow the same interface without always subclassing directly.

Week 10:
This week I worked on data models, properties, and special methods in Python (Week 10 exercises). I used ChatGPT to clarify how to design frozen value objects (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`) for immutable authors, how to implement containment predicates and defensive accessors in a Catalog, and best practices for pretty-printing tabular data. I also asked for examples of sorting with `key=` functions and a minimal `unittest` scaffold. Chat help let me move quickly from concept to runnable code and catch edge cases (e.g., title validation and copies validation).

Week 12:
This week I used AI to help me improve my overall habits outside of class, specifically focusing on my gym routine and eating habits. I asked ChatGPT for guidance on better workout structure, how to avoid repeating exercises too close together, and how to build meals that support muscle recovery even with a low appetite. The AI also helped me understand how to time protein intake, what foods to prioritize, and how to maintain more consistent habits throughout the week.
